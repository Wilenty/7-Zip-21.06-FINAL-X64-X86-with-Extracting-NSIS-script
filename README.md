Preventing being accused of "breaking the license" (qote from www.techopedia.com - link after the text):
#### What Does Lesser General Public License (LGPL) Mean?
* Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a license for open-source software that allows for provisions for including elements of free software in either free or proprietary software. Lesser General Public License is sometimes referred to as "Library GPL" or "GNU libraries," and some associate it with the idea of engineering for libraries in shared resources.
#### Techopedia Explains Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
* In some ways, LGPL is considered a "weaker" license than the general public license. It provides less of a standard for source code analysis, but there are still requirements for transparency and attribution. For example, some industry insiders differ over the specific requirements attached to LGPL licenses, and in what ways users can put open-source projects into their own applications. Many experts recommend using an attorney to review an LGPL before including free software elements as part of a proprietary product. The wording of a license can make a difference in how it can be used, and some general characterizations fail to provide a full understanding of what an LGPL license allows and covers.
